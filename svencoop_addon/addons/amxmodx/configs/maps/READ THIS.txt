Dear server owners,

PLEASE use the .ini in this folder to disable any plugins that would break atmosphere, like XP mod, glow, hook, roll the dice, etc.

The plugins will be disabled only for this map and will turn back on by themselves as soon as the map changes. Be sure to make a new line for each plugin, copying the example 'scxpm.amxx disabled' template.

So PLEASE help me keep the atmosphere of this map by temporarily disabling any crazy plugins. XP mod would ruin this map. It wont kill you to disable it for one map. It's the least you could do to preserve the atmosphere we've worked so hard on achieving.

Thanks in advance,

Cocyx & Soctom
