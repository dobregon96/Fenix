Welcome to the crazy maze !!!.
You and your team have to get
the end of the labyrinth to
access to the control room !.
Inside it, you find 10 buttons
with funniest effects like the
friction, or the crusher :P.
You can help your team too with
activating the way.

Good luck and have fun in the
crazy maze !
