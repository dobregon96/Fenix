This map is made to be one of hardest.So i suggest you to play the map multiple times , so you can remember the position of the enemies.There are many secrets as well.And by the way , i suggest you to take cover when ever possible.Only the strong ones can handle this map! 

Thanks to Neil Manke for TH textures and every one who plays it.Thanks that you have patience to die 50 times and not to give up ;)
