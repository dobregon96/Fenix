Incoming transmission.
Right you've made it this far.
The terrorist have full control of the train station beyond
that door.
They know you coming and have snipers waiting for you,
The terrorist have started a nuclear missile launch
get to the other end of the train line and stop that launch.
You’re not going to like this, but the only way to stop it
now is to blow it up in its silo.
Close the silo launch door and smash all equip.
However there’s a nuclear blast shelter nearby,
Currently occupied by the terrorist leaders.
Evict them.....
