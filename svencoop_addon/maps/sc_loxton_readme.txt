[..Original Idea/Concept..]

Becoming enthusiastic after playing Sven Co-op I decided it was time for
me to make my own. This is one of my first maps and was made when I was 15. This
was finished around 2 years ago but I have only just got around to releasing it.

[..Installation..]

place the map in your SvenCoop/maps directory and at the map listing select
'Loxton'


[..Hints..]

Destroy all the boxes at the start for goddies. Give the turrets all you have got as
they will kill you quickly if your not fast. In the library/office is the hidden shotgun.
You need to flick a hidden switch which is located in the book shelves. Try moving
a chair to enter the vent. Crouching also helps. Finally if a box has 'fragile' marked
on it, I am sure it has a good reason to.

Sorry if it is hard in the warehouse. I guess to finish the map, you need to be good at moving
around. And the map is supposed to end when you jump down the lift shaft. If anyone knows how to
do this, please email me!
