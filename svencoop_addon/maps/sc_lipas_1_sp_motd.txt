Welcome to the SC_Lipas!

Story:

It has been 19 hours since the moment you were sent into a middle of a war in a research facility somewhere in New Mexico. After hours of exhausting fighting you had to fall back to get yourself back together, after being beaten up by an unknown military force and some kind of aliens pretty badly... Somehow you managed to find your way into a small storage room near one of the facility's entrances. Unfortunately you couldn't bring more than just few weapons with you, which just happens to include your old good reliable shotgun and a submachine gun that you found from a  blood puddle . And even more unfortunately the military managed to find a way to follow you and it is only a matter of time until they will find your hiding spot. It seems that your only option is to grab all the ammunition you can get your hands into and storm back into the facility, and this time find a way to get the hell out of there safely, once and for all!
