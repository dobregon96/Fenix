You are working for a illigal organisation named :

UHAF = United Hazardous Actions Faction

This organisation deals in special weapons and controls alien border worlds.
After years of training its time for your first mission. This evening the
alarm sounds. You report to the briefing room listening to the commander.
You hear that aliens have invaded the UHAF secret underground facility where
the weapons are stored. The gouvernement has sent their soldiers to clean up
the aliens. The UHAF is afraid that the gouvernement will discover their
secret weapons. Thats why you are going to sent in. Take control of the
facility by killing the invading aliens and make sure the gouvernement
soldiers can`t tell anything ofwhat they have seen there !

Now move out soldier !
