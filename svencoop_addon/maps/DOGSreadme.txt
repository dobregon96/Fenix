  Description: 'Found headcrabbing, but can't play!' error repeats in the first map in -dev mode
  Cause: Sven tells me it is a problem w/ the scripted_sequence on the dead hgrunt in the security room.
  Fix: If you can fix it let me know, otherwise just deal w/ it. Temp Fix: Type 'r_speeds 1' in the console to cover the         error up) 
[- Sven's note: Can only be fixed in the map. It doesn't really mess anything up, though... just don't play the map in -Dev mode (you can disable dev mode by typing "developer 0" into the console). -]

  Description: Map doesn't work
  Cause: varies
  Fix: E-mail me about it

  Description: Map is really hard on the 'Hard" setting
  Cause: You set the difficulty to high
  Fix: Turn down the difficulty 
[- Sven's note: To do this in SvenCo-op, open the map CFGs (dogs1.cfg - dogs3.cfg in svencoop\maps\ directory) in a text editon such as Notepad, and change the "skill 3" line to "skill 1" (or 2) -]

OTHER:
Help: I have put together a few spots that are hard(er) or confusing.  If you can't get past them read these.
  Description: The part in the first level where you need to go through the big cargo crate - Can I get on them?
  How to Solve: Yes! You can get on them.  Look for a ladder behind the first sandbag wall w/ the guy w/ the ARgrenades.

  Description: The part where you need to open the door into the 'ION INTAKE' in the third level
  How to Solve: There is a small block on the ground under the word 'ION', push it in.  For coop players just use both of the      retina scanners at the same time.
