Incoming transmission.
Good morning commander hope you’re well rested.
I'll get straight to the point.
A hostile terrorist force have taken control
of part of the Black mesa facility.
They are demanding 10 Mil or they’ll launch a nuke.
We have no idea if they have the capacity to launch or not.
Your mission is to go in assess the situation
and remove this terrorist group with extreme force.
Weapons are O.S.P. as always.
More Intel to follow....
