************** Story to map Save Sven Viking ************************

After a long night Sven returns to his office, finishing his new version of SvenCoop,
when he sit down on his black chair, 3 grunts force his door and storm his office.
Sven picks up his shotgun and shoots the Squadleader in his head. The 2nd grunt tries to
get Sven but Sven shoots him his leg off so he flies out the door. When Sven looks behind him,
he sees a big foot (KICK) right in his face. When he wakes up he found himself in a prison 
with THE EVIL G-MAN (scary sound!).
-"Well, It`s looks ehh..(always making that noise) our guest woke up.." said 
  THE EVIL G-MAN (another scary sound!)
-"What do you want from me ? said Sven.
-"I noticed ehh.. SvenCoop is the best HL mod there is, so you ehh.. must be very 
  intelligent, ehh.. So I want your BRAIN (very scary sound!).
-"WHAT ? MY BRAIN ? U NEVER GET IT BLOODSUCKER ! (Sven yelling)
-"Yesss, ehh.. braintransplantation is a new technology, we need it to ehh.. test first.
-"Test ?"
-"Yess, some guy named ehh.. what was his name again ?"
-"Sir, Freeman Sir!" said the grunt with one leg.
-"ehh.. yess. Gordon Freeman..I remember. We didn`t need him after all.. I remember much
  about him... ehh. When he was still in that... 
- (Sven interrupting) "I was thinking this story was about me !?"
-"ehh.. yesss Mr Viking. You still have ehh.. 4 hours left, use them wise.."
