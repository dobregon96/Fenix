Map made by Kaski (Alias Kaksikasvoinen alias Zen)

SC_Lipas for Sven-Coop

Includes 1st part of the map series, finished long back in 2009, In it's all outdated and grammatically incorrect glory!

The original plan was to release all the parts, in both single and multiplayer form, altogether long ago, but I never got around finishing the second part. Back in the day, my online handle was "Kaski" or "kaksikasvoinen", some of my other works prior to 2010 might still be floating around somewhere online and if for some odd reason you recognize my old handle, I figured it might be nice for you to know that these days I go by the name "Zen".
