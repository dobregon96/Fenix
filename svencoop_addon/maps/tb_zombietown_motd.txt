=========================================================

Welcome back Commander, I see they managed dig you out that blast shelter, in the end!
You know, i lost $30 in a bet to see how many weeks it would take them to dig you out.

Oh well down to business....
Since you've been gone, the alien problem from Black mesa seems to be spreading.
we had a research town just outside Black Mesa & they where close to a discovery.
However we lost contact with them a couple of days ago,
satellite images showed zombies in the area. The army sent in a unit.
but we also lost contact with them.

So here you are!
The labs where deep unground so they may still be intact.
Weapons are osp as normal, however we've loaded you up with ammo.
Get into the labs we'll contact you again then.
Good luck, over and out....
